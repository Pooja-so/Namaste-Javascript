## What is closure?

- A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).

## Advantages of closure?

- Closure in JavaScript is a form of lexical scoping used to preserve variables from the outer scope of a function in the inner scope of a function. Lexical scoping is the process used to define the scope of a variable by its position in the source code.
- Here is very good reason that why we have closure in javascript. Javascript has Lexical Scope.
  Lexical Scoping means the variable that are defined outside your scope are automatically available in inner scope, which means you donâ€™t need to pass those to inner scope.
